## Why R
Which tools are used at work in Data Science?

![From Kaggle 2019 survey](Kaggle_Programming_2019.png){width=500px}


## Where to get R

* RStudio provide a good development environment: https://rstudio.com/

\pagebreak

## Properties of R

* Specialized in statistical data analysis
* Many functions and packages
    * Extensive functions and packages for statistical analysis (lm, glm, etc), machine learning (xgboost, keras, etc) 
    * Recently developed packages for large data analysis and manipulation

* Can be linked to C/C++ and other languages 
    * Computation intensive jobs can be written C/C++ and then linked 


* limitations 
    * Not a general purpose programming language, so there are limitationsâ€¦


## R vs Python

## R code examples
### Vector & Matrix
Vectors are a fundamental concept in R. Generate a vector of (1,2,3,4,5)
```{r vector1, echo = TRUE}
c(1,2,3,4,5)
```
Other ways to generate a vector.
```{r vector2, echo = TRUE}
rep(1,10)
1:10
```
rep is a function to return a vector (here 1 for 10 repeat). To get a manual of rep, use ?. You can assign a vector to object using <-. For comment, use #
```{r vector4, echo = TRUE}
# comment in the code
x<-1:5
y<-c(5,6,7,8,9)

x
y
x[2]
x[2:3]
x[-3]
x[x<4]
x[1:2]<-c(8, 20)


x+y
x*y
2*x + y

y^2
exp(y)


```
You can generate a matrix using a matrix function
```{r mat1, echo = TRUE}
X<-matrix(c(1,2,3,4), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
X
```
Vector matrix multiplication
```{r mat2, echo = TRUE}
X<-matrix(c(1,2,3,4), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
y<-c(1,2)
X %*% y
```
### Random number functions and summary functions
R has many functions to generate random numbers from distribution. The following code generate 10 random numbers from normal distribution, and get mean and variance of a.
```{r ran, echo = TRUE}
a<-rnorm(10)
a
length(a)
mean(a)
var(a)
sum(a)
summary(a)
```
### Plot
Plotting functions
```{r plot, echo = TRUE}
x<-rnorm(100)
y<- x* 0.5 + rnorm(100)

hist(x)
plot(x, y)
abline(lm(y ~ x), col = "blue")
```
### Loop and if statement
A loof is done as follow
```{r loop1, echo = TRUE}
for(i in 1:10){
  
  print(i)
}

```
You can use if statement
```{r loop2, echo = TRUE}
for(i in 1:10){
  if(i > 6){
    print(i)
  }
}

```

## Data read
To read data, you can use read.table or read.csv function. You can also read data in URL. For example, read JHU data of COVID19 and plot them 
```{r dataread, echo = TRUE}

covid_url <-paste("https://raw.githubusercontent.com",
"/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/",
"time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv", sep="")

confirmed_COVID <- read.csv(covid_url)
SKorea<-confirmed_COVID[confirmed_COVID$Country.Region=="Korea, South",]
SKorea[1:10]
Italy<-confirmed_COVID[confirmed_COVID$Country.Region=="Italy",]

nSouthKorea<-as.numeric(SKorea[-(1:4)])
nItaly<-as.numeric(Italy[-(1:4)])

plot(nItaly, type="l", col="red", main="COVID", xlab="Day", ylab="Number of Cases")
points(nSouthKorea, type="l", col="blue")

# Legend
legend("topleft", legend=c("Italy", "S.Korea"), col=c("red", "blue"), lty="solid" )

```

There are packages for data handling, such as dply. You can  see the following website for the same data: https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/03/05/covid-19-epidemiology-with-r/

To save data, you can use write functions (write.table, write.csv, etc) or save functions.

### User defined function
You can define your own function. For example, the following is a function to return daily confirmed cases from cumulative case numbers

```{r function, echo = TRUE}
Get_nCaseDay<-function(nCase){
  n<-length(nCase)-1 # does not consider last day
  nCaseDay<-rep(0,n)
  nCaseDay[1]<-nCase[1]
  for(i in 2:n){
    nCaseDay[i]<-nCase[i] - nCase[i-1]
  }
  return(nCaseDay)
}

nSouthKoreaDay<-Get_nCaseDay(nSouthKorea)

plot(nSouthKoreaDay, type="l", col="red"
     , main="S.Korea Daily COVID", xlab="Date", ylab="Number of Cases")

```

### ETC
There are lots of packages for data manupulation and analysis. Please look at online materials (there are several youtube lectures), manuals and vignettes.
